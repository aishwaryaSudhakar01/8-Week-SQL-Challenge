# 8 WEEKS OF SQL

I've taken on Danny Ma's 8-Week SQL Challenge to enhance my SQL skills and gain deeper insights into various datasets. Throughout this journey, I've tackled real-world problems by writing complex SQL queries and performing detailed data analysis. This challenge has helped me solidify my understanding of SQL concepts and their practical applications.
